# Requirements

Few command line utilities

	which sed
	which awk
	which grep
	which cut
	which wc

Few packages

	apt install python3 tcpdump tshark gr-gsm -y

Optionally `gsmframedecoder` when dealing with SI5 instead of Func=UI idling frames, but then you would also need the legacy Airprobe code to get the HEX version of the bursts

And of course Kraken with ready to serve rainbow table indexes
