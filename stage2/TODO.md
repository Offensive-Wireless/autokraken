# TODO

- try to get rid of the absolute path crap from `crack`
- consider using egrep -v '^P1|^S1' instead, and deal with the other crap
- deal with "cannot decode" and "parity error: against the frame stamps as requirement.  IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO XOR FAILING FRAMES - do not mention failing decoded frames

	error: sacch: parity error (-1 fn=862570)
	gsmstack.c:301 cannot decode fnr=0x0d296a (862570) ts=1

- keep thinking on improving the next frame boundary, x6x51? or x7x51?

## obsolete

- check C1 C0 C0 C0 cipherbursts
